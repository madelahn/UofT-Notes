# University of Toronto Course Notes
This is a collection of some personal notes I've written for different courses.

The first few notes were written using LaTeX, but I later switched to Markdown for convenience. Regardless, all notes are available as a PDF.

There are likely some errors and mistakes in what I've written, so feel free to message me for corrections or comments :)
